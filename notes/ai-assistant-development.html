      <h1>AI Assistant Development Notes</h1>
      <p>
        At my dayjob, I'm responsible for the team that develops our in-house
        LLM based AI assistant. Since the landscape is changing rapidly, I
        wanted to have a space for me to jot down notes and ideas as I figure
        out the best path forward.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Seeing is believing, or checking it's work</h2>
      <p>
        At my company, I think one of the biggest hurdles for us is to get our
        staff to fully embrace the idea of using AI in their daily work. While
        many are excited about the possibilities, there is still a lot of
        skepticism and fear around the technology. It's also important to note
        that unlike what you read online, I am not seeing this divide between
        fear and excitement along age lines. There are plenty of older staff who
        are excited about AI, and plenty of younger staff who are skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have to keep in mind that I work in a highly regulated industry,
        so there are additional hurdles to overcome in terms of compliance and
        data security. To handle both the fear and the regulatory concerns, I
        think one of the best approaches is to focus on transparency as the
        system does its work. If the user can see how the AI is arriving at its
        conclusions, they are more likely to trust it.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we do this? Well, currently while our AI assistant doesn't have
        access to tools or skills, it does sometimes have access to data in the
        form of things like pdf or word documents, plus information added to
        it's system prompt in certain circumstances. Most of the use of our
        assistant is through our "general chat" interface, where the user can
        ask it questions in natural language, similar to ChatGPT. Therefore, we
        have focused on explaining to our users that the AI is trained on data
        up to a certain date, and can answer questions based on that data. We
        have historically
        <b>not</b> found a good way to show the user when the AI is using data
        from documents it has access to.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we explore making the system much more capable, and thus complicated,
        it's important to figure out how we can show the user the steps that the
        assistant took to reach its conclusion, and any data or tools it used
        along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently using pieces of the Vercel AI SDK to build out our
        interface, and we can take some inspiration from how they expose tool
        calls in the response data. At the bare minimum, we should be showing
        users when the AI uses a tool, what tool it used, and the input and
        output of that tool. This will help build trust with the users, as they
        can see exactly what the AI is doing. But we must also be careful not to
        overwhelm the user with too much information. We need to find a balance
        between transparency and usability.
      </p>
      <h2>Tools and Skills and Data, oh my</h2>
      <p>In other words, naming is hard lol.</p>
      <p>
        I am very excited about the pace of development in the AI space right
        now. I truly do think that if we can all agree on a mental model for how
        things work, we can make amazing progress as an industry. However, the
        current environment is a bit of a mess, with different companies using
        different names for the same things, and sometimes the same names for
        different things. And then you have to explain to non-technical users
        what these things are, which adds another layer of complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of my notes, and what I will try to push my team to
        adopt, here are the definitions I am going to use:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Tools</dt>
        <dd>
          A discrete function or capability of the system, created by software
          engineers. Examples can include things like sending emails, searching
          the web, or running calculations/code. Tools are generally not
          specific to any particular job function, and can be used by anyone
          with access to the system. Since tools are discrete functions, they
          generally have well-defined inputs and outputs, making them easy to
          use and understand. They should also be easily testable and debuggable
          by engineers.
        </dd>
        <dt>Agent Skills/Abilities</dt>
        <dd>
          A detailed set of information or instructions that help the AI perform
          a specific part of someone's job. Skills are generally created by
          subject matter experts (SMEs) who understand the nuances of a
          particular job function. Examples can include things like customer
          support, medical diagnosis, or legal research. Skills are generally
          specific to a particular job function, and may require specialized
          knowledge to create and maintain. Since skills are more complex than
          tools, they may not have well-defined inputs and outputs, and may
          require more interpretation by the AI. Skills should be regularly
          reviewed and updated by SMEs to ensure they remain accurate and
          relevant. Skills may also incorporate multiple tools or data
          connectors to accomplish their goals.
        </dd>
        <dt>Data Connectors</dt>
        <dd>
          A way to connect to and retrieve data from a specific source system.
          Data connectors are generally created by software engineers or data
          engineers who understand the source system and how to access its data.
          Examples can include things like connecting to a CRM system, document
          repository, or database. Data connectors are generally specific to a
          particular source system, and may require specialized knowledge to
          create and maintain. Since data connectors are focused on data access,
          they should have well-defined inputs and outputs, but may require some
          interpretation by the AI. Data connectors are the means by which the
          AI can access up-to-date information from various systems to inform
          its responses. Unfortunately, data connectors are the most poorly
          defined of these three terms in the industry right now, and the
          implementation of specific data connectors can vary widely between
          exposing tools, or clis that are called by a tool, or MCP servers that
          can expose other tools to the AI. Therefore, it's important to clearly
          document the functionality and purpose of each data connector to avoid
          confusion.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I know that these definitions may not be perfect, and I promise that
        others in the industry may use different definitions. But I think it's
        important to have a common language within my team, so we can all be on
        the same page. The biggest hurdle is going to be setting clear
        boundaries between these definitions, because they are all fungible. For
        example, if I want to information about who worked on a particular drug
        trial, is that a tool call to a database, a skill that's all about drug
        trial information, or a data connector that is particular to that source
        system? Any of those could be correct, depending on your point of view,
        which could make this a fool's errand. But I still have to try. Which
        leads to this summary:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >A tool is a function of the system, created engineers, like sending
          emails. A skill/ability is created to help the AI perform a specific
          part of someone's job, like describing how to respond to a customer
          inquiry. A data connector is a way to get data from a specific source
          system, like a CRM or document repository. All three can be toggled on
          or off for/by a particular user based on their needs and permissions.
