      <h1>Random Home Maintenance Notes</h1>
      <h2>Appliance Maintenance</h2>
      <h3>Dishwashers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clean the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher regularly to prevent
          clogs and ensure efficient operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the control panel is unresponsive, try resetting the appliance by
          unplugging it for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that
          doesn't work, check the circuit breaker to ensure it hasn't tripped.
          Also, if the appliance doesn't have a plug (hardwired), turn off the
          power at the breaker for a few minutes before turning it back on.
          Finally, if the issue persists, it might be a blown thermal coupler or
          a faulty control board. Both of these issues can be handled by someone
          with moderate DIY skills.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Washer Machine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the machine is rocking or vibrating excessively during the spin
          cycle, it may be unbalanced. To fix this, stop the cycle, open the
          lid, and redistribute the clothes evenly around the agitator. Close
          the lid and restart the spin cycle. But if the problem persists, check
          that the washer is level and adjust the feet as necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Water Heaters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the hot water in your house smells like rotten eggs, while it may
          be due to bacteria, it's often caused by a chemical reaction between
          the anode rod in the water heater and the sulfate in the water.
          Replacing the anode rod can normally fix this issue. This is an
          involved fix, so you should probably hire a plumber unless you're very
          comfortable working with plumbing.
